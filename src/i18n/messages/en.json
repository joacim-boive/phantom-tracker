      "description": "Temperature can significantly affect phantom pain. Many amputees report increased pain during cold weather due to vasoconstriction, while others experience relief. Body temperature regulation is closely linked to nerve sensitivity.",
      "fact1": "Cold temperatures can cause blood vessels to constrict, potentially increasing nerve sensitivity",
      "fact2": "Rapid temperature changes are often more impactful than steady temperatures",
      "fact3": "The residual limb may be more sensitive to temperature due to altered circulation",
      "fact4": "Heat therapy is commonly used to help manage phantom pain symptoms"

      "description": "Barometric pressure changes are one of the most commonly reported triggers for phantom pain. Low pressure systems, often associated with storms, can cause tissue expansion that may affect nerve sensitivity.",
      "fact1": "Falling pressure often precedes increased pain reports in many amputees",
      "fact2": "Pressure changes as small as 10 hPa can potentially trigger symptoms",

      "fact2": "Humid conditions may affect prosthetic fit and comfort",

    },
    "wind": {
      "description": "Wind affects the perceived temperature and can cause rapid cooling of exposed skin. Strong winds combined with cold temperatures create wind chill effects that may trigger pain responses.",
      "fact1": "Wind chill can make temperatures feel significantly colder",
      "fact2": "Cold wind on the residual limb can trigger temperature-related pain",
      "fact3": "Protecting the limb from wind exposure may help reduce symptoms",

    "lunar": {
      "description": "The lunar cycle has been historically associated with various health phenomena. While scientific evidence is limited, some individuals report patterns in their pain that correlate with moon phases.",
      "fact1": "The full moon may affect sleep patterns, which can influence pain perception",
      "fact2": "Lunar gravity affects ocean tides and may have subtle effects on body fluids",
      "fact3": "The moon's illumination changes over a 29.5-day cycle",
      "fact4": "Tracking lunar patterns can help identify personal correlations"

      "description": "Geomagnetic activity from solar storms can affect Earth's magnetic field. Some research suggests that sensitive individuals may experience physiological responses to geomagnetic disturbances.",
      "fact1": "The Kp index measures geomagnetic disturbance on a 0-9 scale",
      "fact2": "Solar storms can cause fluctuations in Earth's magnetic field",
      "fact3": "Some studies link geomagnetic storms to increased pain reports",
      "fact4": "Geomagnetic quiet periods (Kp 0-2) are the most common conditions"
    },
    "solar": {
      "description": "Solar activity includes phenomena like solar flares and coronal mass ejections. These events release electromagnetic radiation that reaches Earth and may affect biological systems.",
      "fact1": "Solar flares are classified by intensity: A, B, C, M, and X classes",
      "fact2": "X-class flares are the most powerful and can affect Earth systems",
      "fact3": "Solar activity follows an approximately 11-year cycle",
      "fact4": "Increased solar activity correlates with more frequent geomagnetic storms"
    },
    "tidal": {
      "description": "Tidal patterns are primarily driven by lunar and solar gravitational forces. Some individuals report that their symptoms follow tidal rhythms, particularly those living near coastal areas.",
      "fact1": "Tides follow a roughly 12-hour cycle with two high and low tides daily",
      "fact2": "Spring tides occur during full and new moons with the highest variation",
      "fact3": "Neap tides during quarter moons have the smallest tidal range",
      "fact4": "Tidal gravitational effects extend beyond just ocean waters"
    },
    "sunrise": {
      "description": "Sunrise marks the beginning of daylight and triggers the body's cortisol awakening response. The timing of sunrise varies throughout the year and affects circadian rhythms.",
      "fact1": "Cortisol levels naturally peak around sunrise, affecting pain perception",
      "fact2": "Morning stiffness and pain are common complaints for many conditions",
      "fact3": "Light exposure at sunrise helps regulate the body's internal clock",
      "fact4": "Seasonal changes in sunrise time can affect sleep patterns"
    },
    "sunset": {
      "description": "Sunset triggers the body's transition to nighttime physiology. The reduction in light signals melatonin production, which affects sleep quality and pain sensitivity.",
      "fact1": "Pain perception often increases in the evening hours",
      "fact2": "Reduced activity after sunset may increase awareness of pain",
      "fact3": "The body's natural pain-relief hormones follow circadian patterns",
      "fact4": "Evening pain may be influenced by daily fatigue accumulation"
